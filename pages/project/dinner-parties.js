            In normal times, I host dinner parties every couple months with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/coffeechatsam">Sam Kramer</a> in NYC. 
            They're usually 20-40 people and we try to invite disparate friend groups, friends of friends, and interesting strangers to encourage new connections.
            I cook the main course and Sam's girlfriend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/onehungrybaker/">Ariela</a> (a professional pastry chef!) usually makes dessert.
            <br/><br/>
            If that sounds fun and you're NYC based DM me on <a href="https://twitter.com/NickParkerPrint">Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:hey@nickparker.co">email</a> me :)

            I started this tradition at Cornell <span className="italic">mostly</span> as an excuse to show off my cooking, and it's grown into one of the most
            wonderful parts of my life
